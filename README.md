# 8ball #
8ball is a Yes/No-Question program that answers randomly to your questions. It's based of [nilsding](http://github.com/nilsding)s version, but with some new features and fixes, like *case insensivity* and *clearing the history* and *changing the name of yourself and 8ball* inside the program without looking up the sourcecode.
